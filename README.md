#Description

In its simplest form, "Bleachers" is a web app that users can login into and create chat rooms to discuss current sport matches.

Our motivation behind "Bleachers" was to see if we could create a full stack web app using socket.io that allowed for chat rooms to be created. We continued to brainstorm what these chat rooms would be used for and we landed
on it being used for discussing sport matches. As a group we decided to tackle this challenge since it would provide a great learning experience. Before starting this project none of us knew what socket.io was but the idea
of creating chat rooms piqued our interest. The socket.io documentation and other resources online provided a lot of help in the creation of this project. 

Although there are many choices people can choose from (e.g. Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, etc.) to discuss these topics, we think this project is setting the foundation for a fresh new idea. We are excited to continue learning and building out this project. It is still in early development but keep an eye out!


## User Story
As a sports fan I want to login into a web app and create a chat room to talk about current sport matches.

## Installation
- We followed the documentation for Socket.io ("socket.io": "^4.6.1"): https://socket.io/docs/v4/
- Users need to do an npm i before running the web app.
- Users need to create their own .env file and include a "SECRET_SESSION", "DB_NAME", DB_USER", "BD_PASSWORD".

## Future Developments
We hope to bring users the most up to date sports information and live time match scores. We think this will greatly improve the user experience. Having a friends list and sending friend request is something that will
help with user interaction.
